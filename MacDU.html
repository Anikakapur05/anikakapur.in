                    <p class="mb-30">
                      My time at Maharaja Agrasen College, University of Delhi had been a great and new experience of
                      academic exploration, social responsibility, and leadership development. Graduating in 2023 with a
                      Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and Computer Applications, I left with a deep sense of
                      accomplishment and a strong foundation for the future.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Academic Foundation</h3>

                    <p class="mb-30">My academic journey balanced a strong quantitative background with communication
                      skills. Courses in Calculus, Algebra, Analytic Geometry, and Statistics honed my analytical and
                      problem-solving abilities. Simultaneously, English Language through Literature and Hindi courses
                      fostered effective communication skills in both languages, equipping me to articulate my ideas
                      with clarity and confidence. Additionally, exploring subjects like Environmental Science broadened
                      my perspective on the world and instilled a sense of environmental responsibility.
                      Beyond these subjects, I delved into the world of technology with courses in Computer
                      Fundamentals, Database Management Systems, PHP Programming, Web Designing, and Information
                      Security. These courses ignited my passion for technology and its potential for positive impact.

                    </p>
                    <h3>Beyond the Classroom: Exploring Interests and Building Skills</h3>
                    <p class="mb-30">My university life wasn't confined to textbooks and lectures. I actively
                      participated in various co-curricular activities, discovering my interests and developing valuable
                      skills. Serving as President of the B.A. Programme Departmental Society and a member of the ECA
                      Committee fostered collaboration and honed my organizational skills. Volunteering for the NAAC
                      Advisory Board and the ECA Admission process of Delhi University allowed me to contribute to the
                      college's growth while gaining valuable administrative experience. These experiences not only
                      broadened my horizons but also nurtured my leadership potential and ability to work effectively
                      within a team.
                      My passion for social change led me to volunteer for NGOs like Girlup Foundation. Working with
                      these organizations exposed me to real-world challenges faced by underprivileged communities,
                      igniting a desire to be a part of the solution.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Leadership and Social Impact</h3>
                    <p class="mb-30">
                      Leadership roles played a defining role in my journey at Maharaja Agrasen College. As the College
                      Unit President of the National Service Scheme (NSS), I had the privilege of leading a team of over
                      100 volunteers. Together, we organized over 30 impactful events across 8 projects, making a
                      tangible difference in the lives of over 700 underprivileged individuals. These projects weren't
                      just about volunteering; they were about creating lasting change. Imparting education to over 150
                      slum children, organizing tree-planting drives to combat climate change, and educating women about
                      menstrual hygiene were initiatives that filled me with a deep sense of accomplishment. Witnessing
                      the positive outcomes of these endeavors fueled my desire to be a changemaker.
                      Furthering my commitment to social impact, I founded Macstak, a tech society with a vision of
                      empowering students. Over two years, I spearheaded the organization of over 45 workshops and
                      competitions, equipping over 3,000 students with valuable technical skills. This experience wasn't
                      just about technology; it was about building a platform for inclusivity and growth. Leading a
                      team, managing resources, and fostering a collaborative environment honed my leadership abilities,
                      creativity, and communication skills.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Real-World Exploration: Internships and Applied Knowledge</h3>
                    <p class="mb-30">

                      My academic journey wasn't limited to the classroom walls. Completing multiple internships
                      provided valuable hands-on experience and helped me bridge the gap between theory and practice.
                      These internships allowed me to apply the knowledge gained in the classroom to real-world
                      scenarios, further developing my problem-solving and analytical skills. For instance, an
                      internship at Aashman Foundation in the first year itself focused on focused on social media
                      management and being an envoy for change, allowing me to gain practical experience in digital
                      marketing, communication and marketing strategy development. Another internship further enhancing
                      this skillset was at Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies, Mumbai post completion of my
                      second year provided insights into research, content creation, lead generation and project
                      management. Here I also learnt about data-driven marketing tactics, presentations, communication
                      and adaptability.


                    </p>
                    <h3>Interests and Skillset Development: Blossoming Under the College Canopy</h3>
                    <p class="mb-30">My time at Maharaja Agrasen College wasn't just about academics and leadership. It
                      was a constant process of skill development. Through various experiences, I honed my
                      communication, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities. Critical thinking and adaptability became
                      second nature as I tackled diverse challenges. University life was a playground for discovering my
                      interests and developing a diverse skillset. Participating in debating, poetry, and acting
                      competitions not only nurtured my creativity and communication skills but also instilled
                      confidence in expressing myself. These experiences allowed me to explore different facets of my
                      personality and hone my ability to think on my feet. Juggling academics, social initiatives, and
                      extracurricular activities honed my time management and organizational skills. The collaborative
                      nature of student life fostered teamwork, critical thinking, and adaptability, as I navigated
                      diverse situations and worked effectively with a range of individuals. Furthermore, these
                      experiences fostered my leadership potential, allowing me to develop creativity and emotional
                      intelligence while working effectively with diverse groups.

                    <p class="mb-30">
                      My time at Maharaja Agrasen College wasn't just about acquiring knowledge; it was a crucible that
                      forged me into a well-rounded individual. The curriculum provided a powerful blend of analytical
                      thinking and clear communication. Leadership roles in the NSS and Macstak fostered my ability to
                      lead, collaborate, and solve complex problems. Juggling academics, social initiatives, and
                      extracurricular activities instilled exceptional time management skills. From lively debates to
                      technical workshops, student life nurtured my creativity, emotional intelligence, and
                      adaptability. As I graduate, I carry not just a degree, but a toolkit of skills and a heart
                      brimming with the satisfaction of contributing to positive change.
